# NLP
The goal of this project was to practice Natural Language Processing on text snippets, produce NER and dependency graphs, and perform Sentiment Analysis on the tokenized text. SpaCy was used to preprocess text documents and produce the necessary graphs. The Afinn Lexicon was used for Sentiment Analysis and Scikit-Learn was used to perform k-means clustering.
